// you must use: tatum.io

// 1) create ltc wallet in a safe way (mainnet)
// ...

// 2) generate just three different addresses for receiving
// ...
// plus: add a console.log with the current balance of each address

// 3) send ltc to any address
// ...





// optional plus:
// use ledger account and offchain api to receive and send transactions
// offchain api doesn't need the "fromAddress" and it also let you set a specific fee

// it would be cool adding somewhere a console.log with the current account balance

// in this case, we don't care about internal transactions between ledger accounts (that are instant and feeless),
// because all transactions will be to blockchain
